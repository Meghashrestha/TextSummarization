# Text Summarization with NLP

This repository contains code for text summarization using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. We have fine-tuned and optimized three distinct NLP models: BART, T5, and PEGASUS, to achieve maximum accuracy for summary generation.

## Features

- Utilizes Python for implementation
- Developed and tested on Google Colab
- Three NLP models used: BART, T5, and PEGASUS
- Achieved an accuracy score of 58% for summary generation

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: PyTorch, Transformers, TensorFlow (for T5), Hugging Face's Transformers library
- Google Colab

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-summarization-nlp.git
    ```


## Usage

1. Ensure you can access Google Colab or set up a similar environment.
2. Open the notebook in your environment.
3. Run the cells to fine-tune and optimize the NLP models.
4. Evaluate the accuracy of the models.
5. Generate summaries using the trained models.
